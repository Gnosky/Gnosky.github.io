        "This colab provides some starter code for replicating the paper \"Super Resolution On Global Weather Forecasts\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper focuses on increasing the resolution of GraphCast predictions without augmenting the original graphcast model. The beginning of this notebook was a deepmind product that displayed how to use graphcast and is available here: https://github.com/google-deepmind/graphcast/blob/main/graphcast_demo.ipynb\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary of the work:\n",
        "The paper we are attempting to replicate took coarse graphcast predictions (1 degree of resolution) and learned a function that maps it to ground truth ERA5 data at .25 degree resolution. This notebook is intended to provide some start code for that process. As such, I relied on only a day of ERA5 data so that the code would run fast. If I were to flesh this out, I would ramp up the dataset greatly as well as introduce more model architectures and methods of evaluating the models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper focused on modelling temperature and I focused on modelling the u_component of wind as my conversation with Technosylva led me to believe that modelling wind was important to them. Getting a taste of this type of dataset gave me a good taste of how rich these problems are. There are so many variables to consider and so many physical constraints that I haven't even begun to wrap my head around.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note on compute:\n",
        "To generate this notebook, I used the high-ram version of TPU v2-8 on google colab. It's possible you could get away with using less, but for purposes of getting this done quickly, I used as much compute as I could so that I didn't have to focus on optimizing."
